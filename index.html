            <h2>Biography</h2>
            
            <p>
                Born without consent in 1994.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Attended Banting Memorial High School, and previously attended Georgian College as an Opticianry Student
            </p>
    
            <p>
                I previously obtained a GPA of 90% in Opticianry, a very challenging program! I self taught myself
                Javascript, Python and C# for fun while learning how to develop video games as a hobby, which led me to
                pursuing programming as a career.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                While I initially got into programming as a hobby game developer, I don't think I want to go into that
                field. I'm still not entirely sure which field of computer science I want to venture into but will likely go
                into web development or app development.
